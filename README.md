## Food Image Classification:

* Produced a model using EfficientNet Neural Network to detect the food type from the image of food uploaded. The link to the Jupyternotrbook is()
* Developed a model for the prediction using Streamlite(  http://192.168.0.66:8501).
* Deployed the model using Google Cloud Platform. 

## Tools Used

* Jupyter Notebook
* Streamlit
* Google App Engine
* Docker System
